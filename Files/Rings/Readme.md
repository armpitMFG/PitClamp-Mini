### Pick a ring for your motor based on which actuator head design you are using.  
 - **"Default"** has two diagonal motor mounting bolts recessed an additional 5mm.
    - This is to match the Default OSSM motor head allowing for 4x m5x40mm to be used instead of needing m5x45 for two of them due to the offsets of these mounts in the motor head.
 - **"Alternate"** has all 4 motor mounting bolts recessed the same amount.
    - This is for motor heads such as "Universal motor head" which have matching bolt lengths for assembly.

After testing various designs, the offset has been standardized at +5mm to allow ample clearance for rail tensioners and a sturdier ring.  

Passthru allows for the option of running wires through the ring.  

v1.1 Ring (only available for 57AIM) can use M5 nuts or M5 Coupling Nuts (20mm) to connect an optional rear motor cover. This is the recommended setup.

Most common would be 57AIM - Default, which uses ["PitClamp Mini - Ring v1.1 - 57AIM - 5mm Offset +Passthru.stl"](https://github.com/armpitMFG/PitClamp-Mini/blob/main/Files/Rings/PitClamp%20Mini%20-%20Ring%20v1.1%20-%2057AIM%20-%205mm%20Offset%20%2BPassthru.stl)
