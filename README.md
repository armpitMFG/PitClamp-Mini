# PitClamp Mini

### [Bill Of Materials](BOM.md)  

### [Assembly Guide Videos](ASSEMBLY_GUIDES.md)

### [Demonstration Videos (SFW)](DEMONSTRATION_VIDEOS.md)

## Summary    
3d printed modular quick-release adjustable and removable mount ecosystem for iHSV57, 57AIM, 42AIM, NEMA23 motors. Intended for use with [OSSM](https://www.researchanddesire.com/open-source-sex-machine). 4040/3030 extrusion, flat mount, or clamping base.  

Stress tested to 50 ft-lb without grip being compromised. (PLA 5 walls 15% crosshatch infill)

## Features  
  - 4 degree precision quick-adjustable rotation
  - Motor can be quickly removed from mount for storage or use in another base
  - Selection of bases for different use cases
    - Extrusion Top Mount
      - (Extrusion agnostic, but was designed for as small as 3030)
    - Quick Clamp Ratchet + 3030 Extrusion Mount
      - (This mount is the reason behind the whole project)
      - POWERTEC 71408 is the clamp pictured
      - "Guide rail MFT ratchet clamp" search term to find similar prodcuts
    - Double Hinge Folding Mount
       - (Folds flat for easier frame storage, e.g. sliding under bed)
    - (FUTURE) Fully printed Tabletop Clamp
    - (FUTURE) PitClamp-As-Hinges
    - (FUTURE) Pneumatic SC40 Cylinder Pump
  - (FUTURE) Relocatable OSSM Reference Board v2
  - (FUTURE)(Optional) Capacitor located on motor for solder-less pre-v2.3 board compatability

## Motor Head Support:
  - Default OSSM (57AIM and iHSV)
  - SpockAroundTheClock's Compact Motor Head (42AIM)


## Motor Rings:

## Printing:
The entire project is intended for:  
  - 0.4mm nozzle (Wider should not cause problems)
  - 0.2mm layer height (Necessary for some built-in helper features)
  - Standard strength (5 wall) profile
  - 15% gyroid or crosshatch infill
    - Higher infill optional

All parts tested in PLA and PETG  

Supports required for:
  - PitClamp Mini - Common - Handle
  - PitClamp Mini - Base - Standard - Lower
  - PitClamp Mini - Common - Upper
  - PitClamp Mini - Ring - 57AIM
  - PitClamp Mini - Ring - iHSV57
